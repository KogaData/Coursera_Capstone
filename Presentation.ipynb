With this analysis, we can easily highlight the direct areas of opportunity EMKO holdings can start building on or work to overcome. Using the cluster results, we are able to derive EMKO holdings' SWOT analysis chart.\n- strengths: EMKO 's financial strength, skills set, reputation in Canada etc\n-  Weaknesses: internal faults within the company's control\n- Opportunities: requires looking at the banking industry, market and world as a whole to identify chances for a company to grow the business\n- Threats: like opportunities, exist outside the company, but can be damaging to its success and profitability. We consider government regulation, influence of other companies, the economy, consumer trends, and more.\nUsing this analysis, as a snapshot for company's potential performance, and inspecting the clusters we observe the following:\n- weaknesses<br>\nInternal matters:\n- strengths<br>\nInternal matters:\n- Opportunities: <br>\nWe see that EMKO holdings has highest prospects of growth by locating any of its business units in any of the neighborhoods in clusters 5 , 6 and 1 due to lack of competition as there are no many banks in the area. The opportunities in this cluster outweighs the threats. In cluster 7 neighborhood as well, there seems to be many business actives with little threats. \n- Threats:<br>\nHowever there are threats posed if we locate the banks in neighborhoods like Morris heights,  West farms and Norwood as banks there will pose a serious market penetration challenges.<br>\nWe therefore recommend that as its a good idea locating your business in any of the neighborhoods that carries the greatest opportunities for growth like those in clusters 61 5 and 6 and only ATMS and FinTech facilities in areas of greatest threats and of limited business activities like Morris heights, Country club and Wakefield.",
